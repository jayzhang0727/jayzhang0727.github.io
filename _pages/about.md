I am a fourth year Ph.D. student in applied mathematics at University of California San Diego (UCSD). [Rayan Saab](https://mathweb.ucsd.edu/~rsaab/) and [Alexander Cloninger](https://ccom.ucsd.edu/~acloninger/index.html) are my advisors. My research interests include compression and acceleration for deep neural networks using quantization and pruning, low-dimensional and fast binary embeddings for high-dimensional data, and statistical learning theory. Additionally, I am widely interested in the mathematical foundations of machine learning and deep learning, to explore their expressivity, learnability, and generalizability.

I obtained my M.S. degree in statistics at the University of Chicago in 2018 where I was supervised by [Lek-Heng Lim](https://www.stat.uchicago.edu/~lekheng/). Before that, I received my B.S. degree in information and computing science at Beijing Jiaotong University (a.k.a. Northern Jiaotong University) in 2016.
