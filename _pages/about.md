I am a fifth year Ph.D. candidate in [applied mathematics](https://math.ucsd.edu) at University of California San Diego (UCSD). [Rayan Saab](https://mathweb.ucsd.edu/~rsaab/) and [Alexander Cloninger](https://ccom.ucsd.edu/~acloninger/index.html) are my advisors. My research interests include compression and acceleration for deep neural networks (using quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation), contrastive representation learning for high-dimensional data, and generative models. Additionally, I am widely interested in the mathematical foundations of machine learning and deep learning, to explore their expressivity, learnability, and generalizability.

I obtained my M.S. degree in [statistics](https://stat.uchicago.edu) at the University of Chicago in 2018 where I was supervised by [Lek-Heng Lim](https://www.stat.uchicago.edu/~lekheng/). Before that, I received my B.S. degree in information and computation science at Beijing Jiaotong University (a.k.a. Northern Jiaotong University) in 2016.

I am actively seeking for full time opportunities in 2023, including applied scientist, data scientist, research scientist, and machine learning engineer. My [CV](https://jayzhang0727.github.io/files/Jinjie_Zhang_CV.pdf).
