I am an AI/ML Engineer and Researcher at [GSK AI](https://www.gsk.ai/). My research interests include compression and acceleration for deep neural networks (using quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation), contrastive representation learning for images, generative models, and graph signal processing. Additionally, I am widely interested in the mathematical foundations of machine learning and deep learning, to explore their expressivity, learnability, and generalizability.

In 2023, I obtained my Ph.D. degree in [applied mathematics](https://math.ucsd.edu) at University of California San Diego (UCSD). [Rayan Saab](https://mathweb.ucsd.edu/~rsaab/) and [Alexander Cloninger](https://ccom.ucsd.edu/~acloninger/index.html) are my advisors. I got my M.S. degree in [statistics](https://stat.uchicago.edu) at the University of Chicago in 2018 where I was supervised by [Lek-Heng Lim](https://www.stat.uchicago.edu/~lekheng/). Before that, I received my B.S. degree in information and computation science at Beijing Jiaotong University (a.k.a. Northern Jiaotong University) in 2016.
