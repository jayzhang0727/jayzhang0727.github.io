As an Applied Scientist at Amazon, I work on content moderation for large vision-language models (LVLMs) in Alexa AI. Before joining Amazon, I was a Senior AI/ML Engineer and Researcher at GSK AI. My research interests include compression and acceleration of deep neural networks (using quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation), contrastive representation learning, multimodal generative models, and graph signal processing. I am also broadly interested in the mathematical foundations of machine learning and deep learning, particularly in understanding their expressivity, learnability, and generalizability.

In 2023, I obtained my Ph.D. degree in [applied mathematics](https://math.ucsd.edu) at University of California San Diego (UCSD). [Rayan Saab](https://mathweb.ucsd.edu/~rsaab/) and [Alexander Cloninger](https://ccom.ucsd.edu/~acloninger/index.html) are my advisors. I got my M.S. degree in [statistics](https://stat.uchicago.edu) at the University of Chicago in 2018 where I was supervised by [Lek-Heng Lim](https://www.stat.uchicago.edu/~lekheng/). Before that, I received my B.S. degree in information and computation science at Beijing Jiaotong University (a.k.a. Northern Jiaotong University) in 2016.
